Description: Guardian Condminium Care is a local company I used to work with when I was a property manager. Guardian wanted a unique website with NO generic picstures or stock photos. Challenge accepted!!!

I built out a very simple HTML / CSS and Vanilla JS website set up NODE.JS, Gulp and Netlify. This generates a static website and puts it on the distribution network. Its lightning fast, SEO friendly and secure AF!
